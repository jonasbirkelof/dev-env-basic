# Basic dev environment

This basic starter template is setup to work with TailwindCSS, SASS and BrowserSync, as well as autoprefixer.

## Setup

1. Open `webpack.mix.js` and change the browserSync proxy to either your virtual host (i.e. *mydevsite.local*) or your localhost location (i.e. *localhost/mydevsite*).

2. Run the following `npn init` to download and install all dependencies. Add `-y` to skip the setup questions.
